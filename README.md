# FileCatalogUI

FileCatalogUI or DisCat as it is listed in the Windows Store is a disk and folder cataloging tool. It can be used to keep track of files on both removable and non removable drives. 

Keep track of the contents of your files that have been save to CDs, DVDs, USB sticks and memory cards. Anything that can be browsed to through File Explorer can be indexed and searched by file names without having to insert the storage device.

This project makes use of both Template10 and Entity FrameworkCore.
